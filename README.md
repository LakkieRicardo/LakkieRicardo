- Hi, my name is Lakkie
- I'm currently majoring in Computer Science for an Bachelor's Degree
- I'm working at Carl Zeiss AG as a Software Intern
- My email is lakkie@lakkie.net which is the best way to reach me
- My profile is full of projects I do for fun, as tools for other people to use, and for learning
- I'm only focused on general-purpose programming and my favorite thing to do is to write software that people like!
